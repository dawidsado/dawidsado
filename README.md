# •	POTENTIAL OUTFIT FOR CURRENT WEATHER 🌤🧤
https://github.com/dawidsado/PotentialOutfitForCurrentWeather
<br></br>

## •	DESCRIPTION 📌

Using weather API and knowledge about object-oriented programming I developed an app that based on current weather is able to suggest the most suitable outfit for the user.

API from OpenWeatherMap, I used a version with current weather data in the area chosen by me (I picked Warsaw, but it is only an example, location can be changed in the future).

I am planning to extend the app. I want to do unit tests in JUnit.
The main outline of the final app version: 
-	Outfits going to be prepared but in need of a potential trip to other countries
-	The weather forecast will be changed for a longer term, on the date of the potential user trip
-	Forecast will refer to that specific country where the user is heading for holidays
-	Wardrobe might be extended, but it isn’t the most important area of the app
-	At the end-user will receive outfits propositions for his upcoming holidays

# •  CURRENCY CONVERTER JSOUP 💲
https://github.com/dawidsado/CurrencyConverterJSoup
<br></br>

## •	DESCRIPTION 📌

Basic currency converter which enables conversion based on the amount provided by the user to other currencies. (Note that I focused on main currencies – Euro, US Dollar, British Pound, and Polish Zloty). 
To download actual exchange rates I used the JSoup library and the capability to inspect webpage source code.
Then I parse those values into doubles.

Using JUnit framework I created unit tests of every method in Downloader, FromZlotyConversions, and IntoZlotyConversions classes.

Using the basic functions from the external Selenium library and the ability to inspect webpage source code I created an algorithm that is able to log into my student account and check the schedule for the upcoming week.
